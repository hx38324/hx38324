Hi! Here is Xiang! Welcome to my github! It's a new one and I have not uploaded anything useful yet. Now I am a first year Ph.D. student in geosciences.
My research interest is about using numerical methods to solve geodynamics problems. Like plate motions, topography evolution. But I am still new to those
things and learning to do better science. Hope one day I will make this website useful for somebody in their field. [hexiang@utexas.edu]
